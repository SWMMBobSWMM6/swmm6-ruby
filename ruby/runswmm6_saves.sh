#!/bin/bash
# runswmm6_saves.sh - the Ruby SWMM6 engine (runswmm6) for gate/gate.py, which runs
# `ENGINE model.inp report.rpt output.out` in the model's folder. The files the deck SAVEs to ([FILES] SAVE ..., and
# [LID_USAGE] report files; listed by savefiles.py from the swmm6-rust repository, which was written for SWMM6's input
# format and is called read-only) are backed up first and restored after, so a SAVE in the corpus never changes a file
# another deck USEs. The exit status is the engine's.
# The lister turns '\' into '/' in report-file names, as OpenSWMM 6 does; both spellings are backed up and restored
# (SWMM5 lessons/29), so a name the engine opens either way is covered.
# A deck with nothing to back up runs the engine with exec, so that gate.py's timeout, which kills its own child,
# kills the engine and does not leave it running as an orphan.
# SWMM_BIN overrides the engine; SAVEFILES the lister; TMPDIR where the backups go.
# Copied from groovy/runswmm6_saves.sh with the engine changed.
# Written by Claude (Anthropic) for Robert Dickinson's SWMM6 ports; see README.md.
